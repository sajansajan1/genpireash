## 🎯 Key Improvements in Enhanced Prompts

### 1. **Clear Mode Activation**
Each tool type starts with a clear emoji and mode indicator (🎯 LOGO, ✏️ SKETCH, 🖼️ REFERENCE) to immediately set context.

### 2. **Structured Requirements**
Numbered requirements provide step-by-step instructions that AI models can follow systematically.

### 3. **Critical Instructions**
Explicitly states what must be done and what must NOT be done (especially important for reference images).

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy**
Uses emojis (📍, ⚠️, 🎨) to create visual markers for different sections:
- 📍 = Placement/Position
- ⚠️ = Special user instructions
- 🎨 = Design context/message

### 5. **Explicit Deliverable**
Each prompt ends with a clear deliverable statement so the AI knows exactly what output is expected.

### 6. **Multiline Formatting**
Uses `\n` (newline) instead of `. ` (period-space) for better readability and structure in AI processing.

### 7. **Precision Language**
- Logo: "Extract", "Preserve", "Apply cleanly", "Professional"
- Sketch: "Analyze", "Recreate", "Maintain core concept", "Production-ready"
- Reference: "DO NOT copy", "Extract themes", "CREATE ORIGINAL", "Inspired by"

### 8. **Context Preservation**
All three parts are preserved and clearly labeled:
1. Tool-specific instructions
2. User's special notes (if provided)
3. User's original message (if provided)
